# darkyll

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!


## Installation

### As a remote theme

Remove all `theme:` and `remote-theme` line in your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`, then add:

```yml
remote-theme: ve-lee/darkyll
```

## Usage

Copy:

 - `_authors/`
 - `blog/`
 - `categories/`
 - `404.md`
 - `about.md`
 - `contact.md`

In your site's root directory.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/ve-lee/darkyll. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
